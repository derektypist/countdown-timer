# Countdown Timer

The purpose of the project is to provide the countdown timer using plain JavaScript, without any frameworks.  However, Google Fonts (e.g. to Access Font Roboto) will be used.

## UX

As a user, I expect an image to be displayed.  If an image cannot be displayed, it will display alternate text.

As a user, I expect the title and description of the item.

As a user, I expect the countdown to be in the format days, hours, minutes and seconds.  Leading zeros must be included, e.g. 9 as 09.

If the deadline has passed, it will display a message saying that the giveaway has expired.

Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds are Integers.
